The project involved creating a machine learning model capable of predicting user behavior with 90% accuracy. Our team used Python, TensorFlow, and FastAPI to build the backend, while React powered the frontend. The challenge was managing massive datasets, so we integrated scalable cloud infrastructure using AWS S3 and Lambda. Data preprocessing played a crucial role, including normalization and cleaning to ensure high-quality input for the model. As a result, the client saw a 35% increase in efficiency, significantly reducing manual work and improving customer experience. This project demonstrates the potential of AI to streamline workflows and deliver business value."
